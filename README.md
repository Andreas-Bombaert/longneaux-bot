# longneaux-bot
Tweepy bot to respond to my friend tweets with random funny pictures.

If you want to use it you have to replace the os.environ.get('VARIABLE') with your twitter authentication keys and target account or place those in a .env file.

If you're passing because you have problem with twitter authentication while trying to use tweepy, be sure that you activated the OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 on the twitter developper portal, I had trouble with it before finding the source of the problem.
